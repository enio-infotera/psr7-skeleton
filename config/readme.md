#### Configuration

##### Environment Configuration

You should store all sensitive information in 'env.php' and add the file to your .gitignore, 
so that you don't accidentally commit to source control.

Rename 'env.example.php' to 'env.php'.

The ´env.php´ file is generally kept out of version control since it can contain sensitive API keys and passwords.
